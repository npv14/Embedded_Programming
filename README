@ Brief
	This is a pong based game to be played between two UCFK4 boards.
	

@ Instructions

	Step 1:
		Load game.c onto both boards via terminal typing 'make program' in the 
		game.c directory.

	Step 2:
		Push navswitch in as if it were a push button ready up your board.
		Three LEDs on the display will appear, these act as your paddle.
		To move paddles left/right, push navswitch in the left/right direction.

	Step 3: 
		Once board is readied up and other player is ready, pull navswitch towards
                yourself to release ball. 
		Note, either player can release ball, so communicate such that only one 
		ball is released.

	Step 4: 
		Play game by game by hitting the ball back and forth between boards.
		When a player misses the ball, they have lost.
		This will prompt a message "Winner" or "Loser" on each board.

	Step 5: 
		For rematch, reset the board.

	*Tips:
		While playing, if the ball gets lost in transmission between the boards, 
		simply pull downwards on the navswitch to release another ball and continue
		as usual.
